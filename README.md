# Social AI: [Improving Access to Social Services in Berlin](https://n3xtcoder.org/improving-access-to-social-services)

This project aims to develop a social AI search system that utilizes data analysis, web deployment, and natural language processing techniques. It consists of three branches:

- `main`: Contains the introduction and data analysis part of the project.
- `azure`: Focuses on deploying a Laravel website to Azure Web App, with the necessary code and configuration files for setting up the web application on Azure
- `bertvectorhelper`: Dedicated to an Azure Function App that creates embeddings for queries, utilizing BERT-based models to generate vector representations for text queries.

Feel free to explore each branch for more details.

## Challenge

How can we leverage the AI revolution in a responsible way to improve the lives of citizens? We teamed up with partners from tech, the public sector, and civil society to tackle real challenges they face. Together we developed an open innovation program and intense learning journey to get practical with AI!

## Event Details

Event Name: [AI for Impact: Civil Society and Public Life - Open Innovation Programme](https://n3xtcoder.org/events/lhbk5i435_ai-for-impact)

Organizer: [N3XTCODER](https://n3xtcoder.org/about)

## Proof of Concept

The demo app can be accessed at [socialaisearch.azurewebsites.net](http://socialaisearch.azurewebsites.net/).

We are currently investigating design rendering issues. Meanwhile, please pretend the app looks like this: ![design](/misc/design.png)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions in each branch's README file to set up the required dependencies and run the code.

## Main

The `main` branch contains the introduction and data analysis part of the project. Here, you can find the code and documentation related to data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.

## Azure

The `azure` branch focuses on deploying a Laravel website to Azure Web App. It includes the necessary code and configuration files to set up the web application on Azure.
